敏捷(Agility)

Organizations often benefit from faster time to value with cloud services. IT organizations may be more agile because they can prioritize other tasks. Sometimes a specific line of business benefits because it can spin up capacity faster. This will vary depending on the strategy and what specific cloud services are under investigation. Organizations face deadlines related to infrastructure and software support end of life, regulatory compliance, or seasonal business opportunities that require a rapid application delivery or migration. Note that agility is often conflated with productivity

组织通常可以通过云服务更快地实现价值。 IT组织可能更敏捷，因为他们可以优先考虑其他任务。 有时，特定的业务线会带来好处，因为它可以更快地提高容量。 这取决于策略以及正在调查的具体云服务。 组织面临与基础架构和软件支持生命周期终止，法规遵从性或需要快速应用程序交付或迁移的季节性业务机会相关的最后期限。 请注意，敏捷性通常与生产力相关
